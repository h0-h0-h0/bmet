What can I do with GitHub?
Edit a file?
Save changes?
What about a diff - can GitHubb do diff?
Apparently so...
"Every repository contains a Compare view, which allows you to compare the state of your repository across branches, tags, commits, time periods, and more. The compare view provides you with the same diff tooling that the Pull Request view does. To get to the compare view, append /compare to your repository's path."
Well, let's save this - sorry, commit this - and then "... append /compare to the repository's path."
That's an idea (of some sort... ) an "append / appendage" to path - functionality model.

NEXT?
